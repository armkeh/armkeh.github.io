For my egg drop experiment for day 2 of
the Venture girls STEM camp,
I made three different baskets.

* Basket 1: A pop bottle

My pop bottle basket did not work well.
I tried two different parachutes.
I used a hard boiled egg.

* Basket 2: An egg carton

My egg carton basket with a parachute worked okay.
I used a hard boiled egg.
The egg broke on the second drop.
The best part of it was the egg was snug.

My tupperware basket worked well.
It did not have a parachute.
Instead I filled it with shredded paper and cotton balls.
The egg was uncooked.
The egg didn't break!
The best part of it was it was soft.
