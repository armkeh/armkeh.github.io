Disclaimer: this project of mine was left incomplete;
I'm uploading what I have for the moment, and hope to complete
this idea at some later time, when I am using inference rules more.

Also, the solutions posted here have been tested only in plain HTML;
I have not yet utilised the CSS that would be necessary to ensure
the rules look consistent under different styles.

* Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Introduction
:END:

In teaching and writing, I occasionally need
to create inference/deduction rules.

In the past, when working only in LaTeX, I found
[[https://www.math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/bussproofs/index.html][the ~bussproofs~]]
package to be the best solution.

These days though, I work in Org, and want a simple method
of writing these that satisfies these requirements.
1. The Org source
   a. is at least as easy to type as plaintext (ideally easier), and
   b. looks like an inference rule; i.e., there is relatively
      little “setup noise”.

2. It looks correct in /at least/ HTML and PDF export;
   in particular,
   a. the horizontal rule should be the correct length, and
   b. there should be relatively little vertical space
      around the horizontal rule.

This gives us this rubric for judging methods:
|-------------------+-------------------+-----------+----------|
| Criteria category | Criteria          | Pass/Fail | Comments |
|               <r> | <l>               |    <c>    | <l>      |
|-------------------+-------------------+-----------+----------|
|     1. Org source | a. Ease of typing |           |          |
|                   | b. Appearance     |           |          |
|         2. Export | a. Rule length    |           |          |
|                   | b. Rule vspace    |           |          |
|-------------------+-------------------+-----------+----------|

This post documents my different attempts to fulfill these requirements.

* Approach 1 – Plaintext
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Approach-1-—-Plaintext
:END:

Initially, I just wrote the rules in plaintext ~src~ blocks,
i.e., ~#+begin_src text~, ~#+end_src text~.

Using ascii dashes isn't ideal; the rule should be solid.
#+begin_src text
 p   q
------- dashes
   r
#+end_src

Instead, we can use unicode ~em~ or ~en~ dashes.
#+begin_src text
 p   q
——————— em
   r

 p   q
––––––– en
   r
#+end_src
In Org mode and HTML export, the ~em~ dashes work perfectly;
they create a solid rule with the exact length of the the characters entered.
But in the PDF export, they are wider than most characters,
making the rule far too long.
This is a particular problem when working with proof trees.
Although this simple tree looks perfect in Org and HTML,
it is gibberish in the PDF export.
#+begin_src text
 A     B
———   ———  
 C     D     E
———————————————
       F
#+end_src
Possibly the issue with PDF export could be solved by
tweaking the font used in LaTeX, but unfortunately restricting
my font choice just to get pretty inference rules is too big of an ask.

In addition to the problems with horizontal length in the PDF,
the vertical space around the rule is not ideal in both HTML and PDF.
And I can see no way around this problem;
it seems unlikely I will modify the height of the ~em~ dash character.

|-------------------+-------------------+-----------+----------------------------------------------------|

* Approach 2 – Tables
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Approach-2-—-Tables
:END:

There is an environment in Org which has horizontal rules builtin;
the table!

There are several potential ways to use tables to create
inference rule diagrams, and we go from the simple to the complex.

** Approach 2.1 – Starting out – Basic tables
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Approach-2.1-—
:END:

Let's start out with a simple table, with the contents centered.
#+attr_HTML: :frame void
|  <c>  |
| p   q |
|-------|
|   r   |
Right off the bat, this has the advantage that the horizontal rule
is /exactly/ the right width in every format, and its vertical spacing
is /far/ better than the plaintext solution.

This table was generated from
#+begin_src text
#+attr_HTML: :frame void
|  <c>  |
| p   q |
|-------|
|   r   |
#+end_src
where the ~:frame void~ setting for HTML omits the top and bottom rule
that would usually be present for tables. The LaTeX export does not
have these rules by default.

We must tweak the HTML slightly further, though;
the top row is recognised as a header row, and so it's wrapped
in ~<th><\th>~ and in the default style is thus bolded.
We can define a new style for table headers as so:
#+begin_src text
#+HTML_HEAD: <style type="text/css">th {font-weight: normal;}</style>
#+end_src
#+HTML_HEAD: <style type="text/css">.noboldheader th {font-weight: normal;}</style>
and then repeat our table, with the setting ~:class noboldheader~ added.
Additional settings may be necessary depending upon your CSS.
#+attr_HTML: :frame void :class noboldheader
|  <c>  |
| p   q |
|-------|
|   r   |

There are two drawbacks that remain, that will require us to refine this
appraoch; one relatively insignificant, and the other crippling.
1. In both the HTML and PDF export, we must in fact use /non-breaking/ spaces
   to separate the premises; otherwise, the export will not retain
   the spacing between them.
2. *We are completely unable to write a name for the inference rule next to*
   *the horizontal rule*!
   - Org tables are rather simple, and so a row can only contain
     a horizontal rule or text, not both!

*** Conclusion
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Conclusion
:END:

Given problem 2 above, it's not even worth evaluating this approach;
it's not a valid solution. But it may be that we can extend it to become one.
** Approach 2.2 – Enabling names – Manual horizontal rule
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Approach-2.2-–-Circumventing-problems-with-macros
:END:

First and foremost, we need to solve the conflict between using
the horizontal rule and the name of the inference rule.

Given the limitations of Org tables, it seems the only solution
is to not use a proper horizontal rule. Instead, we'll have a cell
containing a macro which creates rules in HTML and LaTeX.
#+begin_src text
#+Macro: bar1 @@latex:\hrulefill@@@@html:<hr>@@
#+end_src 
#+Macro: bar1 @@latex:\hrulefill@@@@html:<hr>@@

Applying this
#+begin_src text
#+attr_HTML: :frame void :class noboldheader
|    <c>     |      |
|  p    q    |      |
| {{{bar1}}} | name |
|     r      |      |
#+end_src
gives us
#+attr_HTML: :frame void :class noboldheader
|    <c>     |      |
|   p    q   |      |
| {{{bar1}}} | name |
|     r      |      |
But with this solution we lose the nice vertical spacing around the rule.

This is easy enough to solve in the HTML. We simply set
the table's ~cellpadding~ to 0.
At this point, we do have to introduce a non-breaking space
before the ~name~, or it will be directly next to the rule.
#+attr_HTML: :frame void :cellpadding 0 :class noboldheader
|    <c>     |       |
|   p    q   |       |
| {{{bar1}}} |  name |
|     r      |       |

On the LaTeX side, we do fortunately have the ability to manipulate
vertical space on the page by calling ~\vspace{_}~ with
negative amounts.
We augment our macro
#+begin_src text
#+Macro: bar2 @@latex:\hrulefill\vspace{-0.3em}@@@@html:<hr>@@
#+end_src 
#+Macro: bar2 @@latex:\hrulefill\vspace{-0.3em}@@@@html:<hr>@@
and replace ~{{{bar1}}}~ with ~{{{bar2}}}~ to see
that the gap above the rule is much improved,
#+attr_HTML: :frame void :cellpadding 0 :class noboldheader
|    <c>     |       |
|   p    q   |       |
| {{{bar2}}} |  name |
|     r      |       |
but the space above the rule is more concerning.
For dealing with that, we can introduce a macro to wrap the premises
—for good measure, we also place the non-breaking spaces in there.
#+begin_src text
#+Macro: premise1 @@latex:\vspace{-0.7em}@@ $1   $2 
#+end_src 
#+Macro: premise1 @@latex:\vspace{-0.7em}@@ $1   $2 
and apply it to admire a perfect recreation of the spacing we had with
a simple table.
#+attr_HTML: :frame void :cellpadding 0 :class noboldheader
|         <c>         |       |
| {{{premise1(p,q)}}} |       |
|     {{{bar2}}}      |  name |
|          r          |       |

That said, we are still left with some smaller issues.
1. The ~premise1~ macro expects exactly two arguments;
   we would like to have a variable number of premises.
2. It would be better to allow a variable amount of space
   between premises.
3. The non-breaking space we entered before ~name~ to account
   for the lack of padding in the HTML creates too much space
   in the PDF.
4. The premises and rules should ideally use /math font/, not plain font.
We can solve all of these with further macro development.

** Approach 2.3 – One step forward, two steps back – A macro for premises
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Approach-2.3-–-The-~premises~-and-~name~-macros
:END:

Spoiler: the development here turns out to not be useable
in a table cell; still, it is a useful step forward.
It just causes a few steps away from a pretty solution in Org,
which have to be corrected for afterward.

*** A bit of elisp
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: A-bit-of-elisp
:END:

We start with a little bit of elisp code which our macro
will use.
#+name: format-premises
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :var premises=() wrapper="%s" :var spacer="   "
(let*
   ;; Find the last non-empty string, …
  ((last-nonempty (position "" premises :test-not 'equal :from-end t))
   ;; … and take only up to that element of the list.
   (premises (seq-take premises (+ last-nonempty 1))))

  ;; Join the resulting list using the spacer, with the wrapper around
  ;; each element.
  (mapconcat (lambda (p) (format wrapper p)) premises spacer))
#+end_src
This code block has three ~var~ arguments:
- ~premises~, which defaults to ~()~, and should be a list of strings.
  Note that trailing emptystrings will be deleted —the reason for this
  will be seen when we get to defining macros.
- ~wrapper~, which defaults to ~%s~, and which should be a format string
  —this will be applied to each premise, to allow for formatting.
- ~spacer~, which defaults to a string of three non-breaking spaces,
  —this will be inserted between each premise.

*** Using the elisp: inline calls
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Using-the-elisp:-inline-calls
:END:

We can make use of this code block, which is named ~format-premises~,
by an /inline source code call/, with the syntax such as
#+begin_src text
call_format-premises(wrapper="*%s*",
                     spacer=" , ",
                     premises='("hello" "world"))
#+end_src
See [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Evaluating-Code-Blocks.html][the Org manual]]
regarding inline source code calls.

This call wraps each of the words ~hello~ and ~world~ with asterisks,
which is the Org syntax for bold, and separates them with three dashes.
Admire the results in the export:
call_format-premises(wrapper="*%s*",
                     spacer=" , ",
                     premises='("hello" "world")) {{{results(=*hello* , *world*=)}}}

Not quite right, actually. By default, the results are wrapped in 
- verbatim emphasis delimiters, ~=~, and outside of those,
- an invocation of the ~results~ macro, which as far as I can tell
  is simply used to demarcate the results, so that
  successive ~C-c C-c~ invocations will overwrite them,
  rather than prepend them.
This can be seen by hitting ~C-c C-c~ on the ~call~, which results in the following
being placed right after it.
#+begin_src text
{{{results(=*hello* , *world*=)}}}
#+end_src
We definitely don't want the verbatim wrapper,
and can do without the ~results~ macro wrapper
—in the end use-case of this ~call~, users would not be
manually invoking it.

Thankfully, the wrappers can be replaced via
the optional ~<end header arguments>~ argument, placed in
(square) brackets after the arguments. These affect the result
of the code block
—an additional optional argument, ~<inside header arguments>~,
would come before the arguments and would apply to the source
block itself; we have no need of this.
We could use ~:results raw~ to eliminate both wrappers.
That is,
#+begin_src text
call_format-premises(wrapper="*%s*",
                     spacer=" , ",
                     premises='("hello" "world"))[:results raw]
#+end_src
results in the expected output
#+begin_src text
*hello* , *world*
#+end_src
which exports as expected, as seen here:
call_format-premises(wrapper="*%s*",
                     spacer=" , ",
                     premises='("hello" "world" "" ""))[:results raw]

*** Hiding the inline calls: introducing the ~premise2~ macro
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Hiding-the-inline-calls:-introducing-the-~premise2~-macro
:END:

Now, this invocation is too intrusive for our purposes.
But we can prettify it into a macro!
Note the linebreaks here are only for presentation;
they cannot be present in the actual macro.
#+begin_src text
#+Macro: premise2
  call_format-premises(
     wrapper="$1",
     spacer="$2",
     premises='("$3" "$4" "$5" "$6"
                "$7" "$8" "$9" "$10"))
   [:results raw]
#+end_src
#+Macro: premise2 call_format-premises(wrapper="$1",spacer="$2",premises='("$3" "$4" "$5" "$6" "$7" "$8" "$9" "$10"))[:results raw]
You'll notice that we have lost some flexibility in the translation:
the macro allows for 8 premise arguments
—I say “allows for” because omitting arguments does not
cause any errors—
whereas ~format-premises~ allows an arbitrary number.
Unfortunately, it seems Org macros don't have support for an
arbitrary number of arguments.
In this case, it seems an acceptable loss; if you have
more than 8 premises —or honestly, more than 4— then
this inference rule presentation is probably the wrong tool for you.

In any case, our macro looks promising;
if we invoke it
#+begin_src text
{{{premise2(   ,/%s/,p,q)}}}
#+end_src
we get nicely formatted output:
{{{premise2(/%s/,   ,p,q)}}}

*** Where it falls apart: no inline calls in tables
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Where-it-falls-apart:-no-inline-calls-in-tables
:END:

Unfortunately, as promising as this development was,
we've reached a point where it falls apart.
If we place our macro into the table,
#+begin_src text
#+attr_HTML: :frame void :cellpadding 0 :class noboldheader
|            <c>             |                |
| {{{premise2(/%s/,   ,p,q)}}} |                |
|         {{{bar2}}}         | @@html: @@name |
|            /r/             |                |
#+end_src
we unfortunately notice on export that it just expands to the
text of the ~call~. 
#+attr_HTML: :frame void :cellpadding 0 :class noboldheader
|            <c>             |                |
| {{{premise2(/%s/,   ,p,q)}}} |                |
|         {{{bar2}}}         | @@html: @@name |
|             /r/              |                |
This is a limitation of Org tables! They do not support
inline code in their cells.

So, we find ourselves at a bit of a dead end.
But there is a solution, which can make use of
many of the pieces we constructed here;
table formulas!

** Approach 2.4 – Automating premises 2.0 – Stepping forward again 
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Solution!
:END:

While we cannot place inline code invocations in table cells,
there is a way to compute cell contents by invoking elisp code:
table formulas!

At this point, the reader may wonder why I didn't immediately
consider table formulas; the reason is the /appearance in Org/ criteria.
By placing the premise calculation in a table formula,
the table is naturally less shaped like an inference rule.
This means the first few solutions I work through here
are not ideal by my standards.
Thankfully, this can be mitigated with some cleverness;
we'll get there eventually.

*** Writing the premises in a formula
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Writing-the-premises-in-a-formula
:END:

As a first venture, consider:
#+begin_src text
#+attr_HTML: :frame void :cellpadding 0 :class noboldheader
|    <c>     |                           |
| /p/   /q/  | @@latex:\vspace{-0.7em}@@ |
| {{{bar2}}} | modus-ponens              |
|    /r/      |                           |
#+tblfm: @2$1='(org-sbe format-premises (wrapper "\"/%s/\"") (spacer "\"   \"") (premises "p" "q"))
#+end_src
The function ~org-sbe~ (“Org-source babel execute”) is necessary to
invoke code in a source block within this file.
It takes as argument the name of the code block
—as a string or as, as we have chosen, a symbol—,
as well as lists for the arguments of the code block,
in the form ~(argument-name value₁ value₂ value₃)~
—so, allowing for lists of arguments—
where each value should be a string.
The premise cell can then be auto-filled by invoking
the table formula with ~C-c C-c~.
Also, notice we have moved the LaTeX code to move up the horizontal rule
to the cell next to the premise, since we are no longer use a macro.
With all that in place, here is the resulting table:
#+attr_HTML: :frame void :cellpadding 0 :class noboldheader
|    <c>     |                           |
|   /p/   /q/    | @@latex:\vspace{-0.7em}@@ |
| {{{bar2}}} | modus-ponens              |
|     /r/      |                           |
#+tblfm: @2$1='(org-sbe format-premises (wrapper "\"/%s/\"") (spacer "\"   \"") (premises "p" "q"))

*** Writing the premises in a commented row
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Writing-the-premises-in-a-commented-row
:END:

We can improve the appearance of solution in Org
at least somewhat by finding a way to place the premises
in the table itself, rather than in the formula.

Thankfully, Org tables account for use cases such as this;
they include /comment rows/, similar to the alignment tag row.
To use them, we must add a first column
—which will not be exported—
which contains a ~/~ for comment rows.

This row can also contain other markers; we actually make
use of two of them immediately. A ~_~ indicates
that the contents of the row are /names/ for the cells below.
A ~^~ is similar, but the names are for the cells /above/.

We can achieve better appearance in Org by using comment rows for
- the premises,
- the rule name,
- the conclusion, and
- the wrapper and spacer.
Then the end user needs only insert a table template, fill in the
comment rows, and evaluate the formulas to get
their inference rule.

We also replaced the ~bar2~ macro with an identical one
whose name looks a bit more like a horizontal rule.
For reference, there are 10 dashes in the name,
and they can easily be typed using ~C-u 10 -~.

** Approach 2 conclusion (for now)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Approach-2-conclusion-(for-now)
:END:

For the moment, the above is where I am leaving this project.

Ideally, what should be done next is to separate the tabular construction
from the table itself entirely; the user would write the rule in simple table format,
and either place a macro or invoke some elisp to generate a table
which exports as the desired tabular.

* Approach 3 – ~ditaa~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Approach-3-–-~ditaa~
:END:

A final approach would be to generate images of the inference rules
using ~ditaa~, a program to generate images from ASCII diagram.

The benefit is that the generated images have a fixed appearance,
regardless of the export filetype; the downside is that ~ditaa~ seems
to use a poor choice of font for unicode, and so the resulting diagrams
look rather unprofessional. A colleague noted they looked like they
were made in Word; a true insult 😀.

If I return to this project, I will generate examples.
