* About me
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: About-me
:END:

I am a PhD candidate, sessional lecturer and teaching assistant
at McMaster University.

I am an avid Emacs user
(see my init [[https://github.com/armkeh/setup/tree/master/emacs][here]]).

* Projects and blog
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Blog
:END:

These project repositories and blog posts are work
outside of my research and teaching.

** Projects
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Projects
:END:

- My [[https://github.com/armkeh/setup][dot files]], primarily for Emacs,
  but also for ~bash~, ~zsh~ and ~isync/mbsync~.
- A [[https://github.com/armkeh/resume][resume template]] in Org mode, which exports neatly to
  PDF, HTML and markdown.
- A /literate/ library
  of [[https://github.com/armkeh/unicode-sty][unicode symbol definitions]]
  to allow use of unicode characters with LaTeX, LuaLaTeX
  or XeLaTeX.

** Blog
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Blog
:END:

So far this is a series of disconnected posts, mostly about
Agda and Org mode.

* Research
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Research
:END:

My current research is on /formalisation/
of /generalised computability theory/.

By /formalisation/, I mean /mechanisation/,
specifically in the proof assistant/programming language Agda.

By /generalised computability theory/, I mean
theory of computable functions on topological algebras
(such as the real numbers),
rather than on the natural numbers.

- [[https://github.com/armkeh/talks/blob/master/cas-apr19-poster/poster.pdf][Poster]] on my research produced for the
  2019 McMaster CAS department poster competition.
  - Which won third place.

* Resume
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Résumé
:END:

My resume is hosted on [[https://github.com/armkeh/resume][my Github]].

The HTML version is also embedded here for convenience.
You may need to refresh the page or wait a short while
for it to display correctly.

#+begin_comment
The iframe here is the full width of its containing box,
and its height is automatically set to the height necessary
to hold its contents without scrolling via a script found
on this StackOverflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9975810/

This will not work correctly in the local HTML file on my machine;
the pages must be on the same domain for this to work
—specifically, both this file and the resume are on my ~github.io~ domain.
