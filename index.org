** Perfectly sized iframes

#+begin_comment
This script will make the height of an iframe whatever height is necessary
to fit its contents without scrolling.
See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9975810/.
It should be used along with ~scrolling="no"~,
and style ~width: 100%~ to make the iframe take the full width.

This will not work correctly in the local HTML file on my machine;
the pages must be on the same domain for this to work
—specifically, both this file and the resume are on my ~github.io~ domain.

* About me
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: About-me
:END:

I am a software engineer most recently working at [[https://www.indexexchange.com/][Index Exchange]], where I
- worked on the core application API team,
- developing backend APIs in Go
  - incorporating technologies including Ansible and Redis,
- and practicing DevOps engineering using Docker, Kubernetes,
  Helm and GitLab pipelines and ArgoCD.

Formerly I was a PhD candidate, sessional lecturer and teaching assistant
at McMaster University,
with a focus on functional programming and the theory of programming languages.

I am an avid Emacs user
(see my init [[https://github.com/armkeh/setup/tree/master/emacs][here]]).

* Game development
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Game-dev

I dabble in game development.

- Sample [[https://armkeh.github.io/breakout-excaliburjs/][Breakout]] game developed in [[https://excaliburjs.com/][Excalibur.js]], coded in Typescript and playable online.

* Research
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Research
:END:

My PhD research was on /formalisation/
of /generalised computability theory/.

By /formalisation/, I mean /mechanisation/,
specifically in the proof assistant/programming language Agda.

By /generalised computability theory/, I mean
theory of computable functions on topological algebras
(such as the real numbers),
rather than on the natural numbers.

  2019 McMaster CAS department poster competition.
  - Which won third place.
