* Research
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Research
:END:

My current research is on /formalisation/[fn:formalisation]
of /generalised computability theory/[fn:generalised-computability].

[fn:formalisation]
By /formalisation/, I mean /mechanisation/,
specifically in the proof assistant/programming language Agda.

[fn:generalised-computability]
By /generalised computability theory/, I mean
theory of computable functions on topological algebras
(such as the real numbers),
rather than on the natural numbers.
