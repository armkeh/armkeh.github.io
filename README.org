* Introduction

This repository sets up my ~github.io~ site.

No real setup is required; by simply naming the
repository ~github-user-name.github.io~, and uploading an ~index.html~,
I have an easy to use website, maintained by committing to this repo.

* The ~gitignore~ file                            :noexport:
